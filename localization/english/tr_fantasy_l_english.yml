Under this twin protection, the wisened and perceptive Silvenari thrive. Even though the wilds are unforgiving, they've learned to navigate the darkwoods and the Broken Coast with ease, and to extend unprecedented hospitality to anyone caught in fate's throes. Valenwood has been the first refuge of many Ayleids fleeing the disorders of their crumbling Imperatum, and the later Alessian pogroms. True to their values, the Silvenari welcomed the refugees despite the starkly alien customs faced by both cultures, and eventually absorbed them into their fold under the guidance and guardianship of the very first Green Lady of Ayleid descent."

The capital of Grahtwood shelters Etarani, or 'Children of the King,' the royal elite of the Bosmer nation. When Hart-King Eplear ruled atop the ever-moving Falinesti, the only period he anticipated would be winter, as two greatest cities of his land would stand beside each other. The subjects that settled in the area profited from the generosity of the itinerant court and came to be — or rather acting — superior to all others. Having the two Elden Tree cities within their borders bestowed them this right. When the Second Empire absorbed their lands in 1E 2714, the woodlords of Grahtwood selectively adopted Imperial customs into dress, speech and governance. As the link between the deepwoods and the Cyro-Bosmer class, they play kingmakers in Bosmer politics."

Even now, the Dunmer of the north-east are a curious lot, prone to paranoia and almost eremitical bouts of secretiveness, exotic and unknown even to their fellow elves, and laissez-faire with regards to cultural norms sacred to their kin."
