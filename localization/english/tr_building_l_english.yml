I'm here to learn about the old woman who attacked me in the Keeper Compound.  Drept said he saw the hag here at the orphanage long ago, when his childhood friend was murdered.  He's never dared to come back, but I don't think I have much choice.  It's a thin lead, but it's all I have left. I've never robbed an orphanage before, and I can't say I'm looking forward to the visit.  There's no telling what I'll find inside.
